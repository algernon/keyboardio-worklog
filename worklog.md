## Kaleidoscope

* Reopened [Kaleidoscope#779][kaleidoscope/779], because it turned out that the alternative ideas I had are full of unsolvable corner cases. Also wrote a bit of documentation about layers, layer keys, and related things.
* Fixed the RGB component order for the Raise, and made it compile again.
* Opened [Kaleidoscope#780][kaleidoscope/780].
