## Kaleidoscope

* Reopened [Kaleidoscope#779][kaleidoscope/779], because it turned out that the alternative ideas I had are full of unsolvable corner cases. Also wrote a bit of documentation about layers, layer keys, and related things.
* Changed `Raise-Firmware` to use `MoveToLayer(n)` ([Trello#40][trello/40]).
