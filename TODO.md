## Waiting for @obra

* Have a look at [Model01-Firmware#49][model01-firmware/49], merge if agree with
  the fix.

  [model01-firmware/49]: https://github.com/keyboardio/Model01-Firmware/pull/49

* Have a look at [Kaleidoscope-LEDControl#19][kaleidoscope-ledcontrol/19], merge if agree.

  [kaleidoscope-ledcontrol/19]: https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope-LEDControl/pull/19

* Provide feedback on [Kaleidoscope-LEDEffect-Rainbow#2][kaleidoscope-ledeffect-rainbow/2]: there
  are two kinda conflicting methods here. One is to use N different
  LEDEffectRainbow instances for the different brightnesses, the other is to use
  a single one, with mode-specific methods to set the brightness.
