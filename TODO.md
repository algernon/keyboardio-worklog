## Waiting for @obra

* Provide feedback on [Kaleidoscope-LEDEffect-Rainbow#2][kaleidoscope-ledeffect-rainbow/2]: there
  are two kinda conflicting methods here. One is to use N different
  LEDEffectRainbow instances for the different brightnesses, the other is to use
  a single one, with mode-specific methods to set the brightness.
